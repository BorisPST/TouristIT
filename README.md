Web application for handling reservations at Villa AdAstra to help with tourism

## Background
The app was created in order to automate the process of registering reservations. This process is currently being handled manually with the use of Excel and notebooks. Automating it will allow for easier maintenance. More features will be gradually added along with statistics graphs on the home screen and user authentication. Note that the application is still a work in progress.

## Technology
The app was developed using Nest.js and Prisma on backend, and Angular and Tailwind CSS on frontend.
